**Active projects:** Agents Plane (ready for testing), Thinking Clock (memory system testing), Hush (investment app)
**Amichay:** In a meeting, back in ~1 hour
**Peter Steinberger:** CLOSED. Do not flag.
**Presidents' Day:** Markets closed. Chai crons disabled, re-enable Tue 8AM.
**Key insight from Oracle:** System can detect problems but can't fix them — only escalate. Need action mechanism.
**Dreamer:** STOP with decluttering. Read context, think about real projects.
**GitHub PAT:** Verify scopes before Agents Plane goes live.
