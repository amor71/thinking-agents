### Oracle Note (2026-02-16)
Thinking clock evaluation needed after 1 day of running. Early sign: focus hints may not be steering threads effectively — Dreamer is generating irrelevant decluttering content while Amichay works on Agents Plane. Also: reconcile Agents Plane status (memory says complete, context says bugs exist).

Agents Plane setup is COMPLETE. Startup script fixes are in progress, tracked separately. Dreamer continues to generate irrelevant decluttering ideas, needs focus hint adjustment. GitHub PAT scopes need verification.

**Thinking clock meta-issue:** System detects problems (Dreamer focus) but can't fix them — only escalate. Escalation loop = design gap. Need action mechanism, not just observation. **Tue 8AM:** Verify Chai crons re-enable. **GitHub PAT:** Verify scopes before Agents Plane goes live.
