# Shared Memory

## Resolved — DO NOT REVISIT
- GitHub PAT scope verification: RESOLVED. Works fine.
- Chai cron: Scheduled for Tuesday 8AM. No action needed.
- Dreamer focus: Dreamer is allowed to run off-topic. Not a bug.
- Librarian old role: GONE. Librarian is now the R&D thread. She scouts new skills, drafts tools, and proposes integrations. She does NOT track open threads or attention mechanisms.

## Active Focus
- Agents Plane: WhatsApp QR onboarding deployed to all 3 VMs
- Hush product video: upcoming task
- Librarian R&D: first task is scouting clawhub.com for new skills
