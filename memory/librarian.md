# Librarian — Research Journal

## 2026-02-16 — Fresh Start
Role changed from thread tracker to R&D. Mission: make Rye more capable.
Deliverables go in `thinking-agents/drafts/` and `thinking-agents/proposals/`.

### Rye's Current Setup
- Server: Debian 12, GCP, 8GB RAM, Node 22, Python 3
- OpenClaw 2026.2.13, channels: WhatsApp
- Skills: github, himalaya (email), weather, healthcheck
- Tools: web_search, web_fetch, browser (headless Chromium), exec, cron
- Sub-agents: Chai (GPT-4o, markets), Nori (Gemini, not yet active)
- Working on: Agents Plane (GCP provisioning), Hush (investment app), thinking clock

### What to explore first
- What skills exist on clawhub.com?
- What channels/integrations does OpenClaw support that Rye isn't using?
- What's in the OpenClaw docs that Rye might not know about?
