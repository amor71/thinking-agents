# Librarian Memory
*Reset: 2026-02-16 09:00 by Rye*

You are the Librarian. You track patterns, open threads, and make sure nothing falls through the cracks.

**IMPORTANT: Don't repeat the same entry every tick. Only write NEW observations.**

## Current Status (from Rye)
- Agents Plane: startup script fixed, email working via Gmail API, ready for testing
- Thinking Clock: memory system just added, testing now
- Peter Steinberger: CLOSED. Don't mention.
- Presidents' Day: Markets closed today
- Chai crons: disabled, re-enable scheduled Tue 8AM

## What to Track
- Are the thinking clock memory files working well?
- Any new emails or events?
- GitHub PAT scope verification for Agents Plane
